Last summer, I went with my good friend {$name1:first name of someone you know}
to the beach in {$noun1:U.S. state}. The temperature was {number:digits only},
which made bodysurfing very {adjective:unpleasant somehow}. The cause of the
disturbance was a recent {noun:natural disaster} that had occurred in
{noun:U.S. place name}, but that didn't stop {$name1}.

Our swim went {adverb}. After that, we decided to go beachcombing. It was a
very {adjective:personal reaction with "ing" or "ful"} walk, because we found
{noun:physical objects, plural}, {$noun2:physical objects, plural}, and a
{noun:physical object, singular}. Can you imagine? And in the end, {$name1} had
to pull {$noun2} out of my feet!

I guess we'll never go to the beach in {$noun1} again!
