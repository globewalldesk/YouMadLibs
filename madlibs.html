  <!-- so here's how it ought to work.

   The page loads as an ordinary HTML page, with JS. The user is given a
   choice of mad libs to fill out. When the user clicks on one, a table
   is shown. This includes part of speech and a text input area, with
   placeholder text that includes extra info as appropriate. At the bottom
   is a "submit!" button. When this is clicked, the table is replaced by
   the filled-in mad lib. An "Another?" button is also available to press.

   Filled-out data for the mad lib should be saved permanently to the bottom
   of the mad lib page.

   Another button should allow the user to start a new mad lib. This should
   take the form of a text input area with some simple syntax, such as < and >,
   e.g., <noun: large animal> or <adjective>. This then *redisplays* the text
   and prompts the user to check if it is to his liking. If he says so, then
   the mad lib is saved as a separate data file and added to the top of the
   list of available mad libs.

   While this app is Ruby/Sinatra on the back end, the server should do
   nothing except the absolute minimum, i.e., what can't be done by JS. So all
   the parsing of text is done by JS.

   First step: create format of text file, display prompts and accept user
   choices, then generate filled-in mad lib to end user.

   The text file having been made, the next step is to create a Ruby/Sinatra
   server script to grab the text when the user clicks a link. (This link will
   be fancied up later.) The text is then passed to the web page and thence the
   JS.
